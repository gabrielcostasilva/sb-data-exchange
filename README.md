# SPRING BOOT DATA EXCHANGE
Playground for managing different format files for data exchange with Spring Boot

This repository groups projects into branches as follows:
- [json](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/sb-data-exchange/tree/json) shows how to manage local JSON files;
- [yaml](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/sb-data-exchange/tree/yaml) extends the JSON project for managing YAML files.
- [xml](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/sb-data-exchange/tree/xml) builds on top of YAML project for managing XML file. However, managing XML is not straightforward as YAML.
